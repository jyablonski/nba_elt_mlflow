## ML Pipeline

The ML Pipeline pulls input data built by dbt for today's NBA Games and uses a Logistic Regression Model to generate Win Prediction %s for every team.

These Win Predictions are served on the Dash Server as well as the REST API.

## Tests
To run tests locally, run `make test`.

The same Test Suite is ran after every commit on a PR via GitHub Actions.
